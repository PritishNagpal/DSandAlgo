## Implementing Data Structures and algorithms

`An Algorithm is step by step set of instruction to process the data for a specific purpose. So an algorithm utilizes various data structures in a logical way to solve a specific computing problem. In this tutorial we will cover these two fundamental concepts of  using the  programming language .`

This repository deals with learning data structures and related algorithms which help in greater understanding of the programming language.
